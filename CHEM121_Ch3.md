##Composition of Substances and Solutions

###I. Formula Mass and Moles
1. **Formula Mass** sum of average atomic masses of the atoms of a substance
2. Covalent compounds formula mass = **Σ { μ<sub>a</sub> }** where μ<sub>a</sub> is equal to each formula element atomic mass times the number of that element
3. Ionic compounds instead use the sum of the simplest ratio of anions and cations because they do not form molecules
4. A **Mole** is equal to the number of atoms of <sup>12</sup>C that weigh 12g AKA **Avagadro's Number** 
	- **Avagadro's Number = 6.022 x 10<sup>-23</sup>**
	- in H<sub>2</sub>O, this is 18mL 
5. **Molar Mass** mass of 1mol of a substance = average atomic mass as g/mol or amu
	- Example: 1 mol of **Na**  has a mass of 22.9898g 

###II. Determining Empirical and Molecular Formulas
1. **Percent Composition** % of each element in a substance
	- Example: **NH<sub>3</sub>**
	
	<pre>
	%N = 14.01 amu  = 82.27%
		------------------------------
		17.03 amu 
	
	%H = 3.024 amu = 17.76%
		------------------------------
		17.03 amu
	</pre>
	
2. Determination of Empirical Formulas
	- Consider a compound determined to contain 1.71g **C** and 0.287g **H**
	- **Empirical Formula** can be found by: 
	
	<pre>
	1.71 g C * 1 mol  = 0.142 mol C
				------------   
			   12.01 g 
			   
	0.287 g H * 1 mol  = 0.284 mol H
				------------   
			   1.008 g 
	</pre>
	Therefore, given the mole ratio, the compound can be described as **CH<sub>2</sub>**
3. Derivation of Molecular Formulas
	- any molecular formula is equal to the empirical formula times an integer
	- this integer, **n** can be found as the molecular or molar mass in amu or g/mol divided by the empirical formula mass
	- Therefore, for any empirical formula in the form **(A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>y</sub>)<sub>n</sub> = A<sub>nx</sub>B<sub>ny</sub>**

###Molarity and Dilution
1. **Molarity** is defined as the number of moles of a substance dissolved into exactly 1L of solution 
	
	<pre>
	M = mol solute
		---------------------------
		1L solution
	</pre>
	
2. **Dilution** is amount of solute substance per unit of solution 
	a. Dilution is represented with the formula n = MV where n is molar amount of solute per M solute molarity and V total volume 
	b. If a new solution is being made, the missing volume or molarity of the resulting solution can be found as: M<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = M<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>
	c. Special Units 
		- Parts Per Million equal to (g solute / 10<sup>6</sup> g Solution) *or* (mL / L)
		- Parts Per Billion equal to (g solute / 10<sup>9</sup> g Solution) *or* (μL / L)
