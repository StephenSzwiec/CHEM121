##Atoms and Ions

###I. Classification of Matter
1. **Substance** any kind of matter with it's own chemical composition and individual physical properties
2. **Elements** are the simplest substances. An **atom** is the smallest unit of any element. Elements are designated by name, symbol, and mass.
3. **Compounds** are chemical combinations of element atoms with chemical bonds. 
	a. **Law of Constant Composition** all compounds of the same type are made of elements in static ratios of combinations
	b. Compounds have different properties than constituent elements
	c. Can be separated via chemical reactions, not just physical forces. 
		Example: **2H<sub>2</sub>O** is separated into **3H<sub>2</sub>** and **O<sub>2</sub>** via electrolysis
	d. Formulas indicate which elements and the actual ratio of combination
4. **Mixtures** combinations of substances *physically* combined
	a. No fixed ratio to mixtures
	b. Each of the components within a mixture keep their own properties
	c. Can be separated 
		- Distillation
		- Filtration
		- Magnetism
		- Chromatography
		- Centrifuge
	d. Mixtures can be heterogeneous or homogeneous
		- **Solutions** are homogeneous; **Solvent** dissolves the **Solute**
		- **Alloys** are also homogeneous mixtures
		- Gasses typically readily form solutions
		- **Amalgam** mercury + another metal

###II. History of Atom Theory
1. Democritus (450BC) - first to suggest matter consisted of small, indivisible particles; meanwhile, Aristotle believed matter was infinitely divisible
2. John Dalton (1808CE) - publishes *Atomic Theory* which includes: 
	a. An element is composed of extremely small indivisible particles called atoms
	b. All atoms of a given element have identical properties
	c. Atoms cannot be created or destroyed (or transmuted) 
	d. Compounds formed when atoms of different elements combine in whole-number ratios
		- **Law of Multiple Proportions** the same elements in different ratios give different elements
	e. The numbers and kinds of atoms are constant per compound
3. Wilhelm Roentgen (1895) - X-rays discovered 
4. Henri Becquerel (1896) - Radioactivity discovered
5. J.J. Thomson (1897) - uses cathode ray deflection to find charge/mass ratio of an electron
	- e/m = **-1.75882 x 10<sup>8</sup>** C/g
6. Ernest Rutherfod discovers three types of radioactivity:
	a. **α particles** have charge of +2, high speed **He** nuclei 
	b. **β particles** have charge of -1, high speed electrons 
	c.  **γ particles** have no charge, no mass, gamma ray electromagnetic waves
7. Robert Millikan of U of Chicago (1909) - Oil drop experiment finds the charge of an individual electron: **e- = 1.6x10<sup>-19</sup> Coulomb
8. J.J. Thomson describes the atom as a "Plum-pudding" model, in which electrons float within a positively charged mass. 
9. Nagaoka of Tokyo University proposes a competing "planet Saturn" model, in which electrons orbit a central positively charged mass
10. Rutherford and Geiger: **gold foil experiment** has an α-particle stream shot at gold foil surrounded by a phosphorescent screen. Plum-pudding model is defeated by large angel of deflection of α-particles.
	>"The were so surprised. It was like shooting a cannonball at a tissue paper and having it bounce back" 
	- Rutherford
	
	- Describes findings in the *Nuclear Model of the Atom* (1912)
11. HGJ Moseley (1913) studies X-rays given off by different atoms; correlates wavelengths with differing atomic numbers and number of protons
12. James Chadwick (1932) postulates other, chargeless particles based on mass missing from atomic nucleus

###III. Atomic Groups 
1. Periodic Table History
	a. Dimitri Mendeleev and Lothar Meyer (1869) independently two competing table designs, which arrange known elements by chemical and physical properties
	b. Mendeleev based his table on chemical and physical properties, and grouped the elements into **periods** with similar properties
	c. Both arrangement were in terms of increasing atomic weights, not number, because protons were unknown at the time
	d. Mendeleev's table left gaps open where he predicted new elements to be: ex, **Si** area left blank and predicts properties of **Ge** 
2. Atomic Groups -Left to Right, **1-18** *or* **IA-VIIA** metals + **B**, **C**, and **D** groups
	a. **A Group** Representative Elements
	b. **B Group** Transition Metals
	c. **C Group** Inner Transition Metals - Lanthanide Series
	d. **D Group** Inner Transition Metals - Actinide Series
3. Representative Groups 
	a. **Group 8A** Noble Gases
	b. **Group 7A** Halogens
	c. **Group 6A** Chalkogens
	d. **Group 5A** Pnictogens
	e. **Group 4A** Crystallogens/ Carbon Group
	f. **Group 3A** Triels/Boron Group
	g. **Group 2A** Alkalide Earth Metals
	h. **Group 1A** Alkalide Metals (minus hydrogen)
4. **Periodic Law** chemical and physical properties start to repeat on a periodic basis 
5. Metals are 70% of the table; metalloids border metals and nonmetals and have properties of both
6. **Allotropes** elements with different forms of that same element; examples: **S** or **S<sub>6</sub>**, **O<sub>2</sub>** or **O<sub>3</sub>**

###IV. Ions and Charges
1. Charges
	a. Like charges repel, opposites attract
	b. Elements and Compounds have a 0 net charge
	c. Humphrey Davy (1800s) shows that charges can decompose substances 
	d. George Stony (1874) - charges proposed to be associated with atoms and electrons
2. Mass Spectronomy and Ionic Abundance
	a. **Isotopes** are atoms of same element with different atomic mass due to differing neutrons 
	b. **Atomic Weight** or average atomic mass is a weighted average of all isotopes of an element
	
	**Atomic Weight = Σ { (mass of each isotope) x (fractional abundance) }** 
	
	c. **Spectronomy process** gaseous sample of an element are heated until gas, bombarded by electrons and separated by (charge/mass) ratios in a magnetic centrifuge
	d. Masses and Abundances are measured with **AMU** (Atomic Mass Units) 	
		- **1 AMU** = 1/12 mass of **<sup>12</sup>C**
		- used for formula units and molecules
3. Monoatomic Ions 
	a. **Anions** negatively charged ions that gain electrons; monoatomic anions are formed from non-metallic elements
		- **Group 7A** charge -1
		- **Group 6A** charge -2
		- **Group 5A** charge -3
	b. **Cations** positively charged ions that lose electrons; monoatomic catons are formed from metals
		- **Group 1A** charge +1
		- **Group 2A** charge +2
		- **Group 3A** charge +3
		- **Transition Metals** charge can change, but always positive hence "transition"
	c. Naming monoatomic anions: Stem + "-ide"
		- Example **H<sup>-</sup>** is Hydride
		- Examples of Binary Ionic compounds: 
			**NaBr** Sodium Bromide
			**CaCl<sub>2</sub>** Calcium Chloride
			**K<sub>2</sub>S** Potassium Sulfide
4. Polyatomic Ions
	a. Some Ions are made of functional groups, which are groups atoms with a net charge which work together
	b. Most Polyatomic Ions are Anions; Polyatomic Cations are NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Ammonium and Hg<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> Mercury (II)

###V. Naming Molecular Compounds
1. **Binary Molecules** if two nonmetals, put most metallic (to the left-top of the periodic table) first, least metallic second with -ide
2. If the first molecule is only one, then it does not need mono-, otherwise always count
