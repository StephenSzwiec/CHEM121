##Chemistry In Context

###Introduction to Chemistry
1. Sometimes called _"The Central Science"_
2. __Chemistry -__ the study of the composition, properties, and interactions of matter.
3. __The Scientific Method__ defined as: the path of discovery that leads from question, to hypothesis, to theory or law
    a. __Hypothesis__ the tentative explanation for an observation
    b. __Laws__ summarize a vast number of experimental observations
    c. __Theories__ well substantiated, comprehensive, testable explanations
4. __Domains of Chemistry__ there are three different domains of chemistry
    a. __Macroscopic Domain__ large enough to be normally observed
    b. __Microscopic Domain__ nanometer range down to individual atoms
    c. __Symbolic__ domain consisting of specialized language, formulas, equations, graphs, drawings, and calculation; abstraction from the reality of chemistry. 

###Chemistry and Measurement
1. Chemistry is a quantitative science
2. SI is used worldwide, but is not quite the same as metric. 
    <pre>
    **Property	  Metric	  Si**
    length		m			m 
    mass		g			kg
    time		s			s
    temp		°C			 K
    amount		mol		    mol
    current		A			A
    luminosity	cd			cd
    </pre>
3. Both SI and Metric are decimal systems with prefixes
	<pre>
	**Prefix	  Abbrev.		  Multiplier**
	Tera-		T				1x10<sup>12</sup>
	Giga-		G				1x10<sup>9</sup>
	Mega-		M				1x10<sup>6</sup>
	kilo-		k				1x10<sup>3</sup>
	Deca-		da				1x10<sup>1</sup>
	deci-		d				1x10<sup>-1</sup>
	centi-		c				1x10<sup>-2</sup>
	milli-		m				1x10<sup>-3</sup>
	micro-		μ				 1x10<sup>-6</sup>
	nano-		n				1x10<sup>-9</sup>
	pico-		p				1x10<sup>-12</sup>
	femto-		f				1x10<sup>-15</sup>
	</pre>
4. Basic derived units
	a. Volume = length^3 -> m^3 or 1L = 1dm^3
	b. Density = mass / Volume: SI - kg/m^3 or metric - g/mL, g/cm^3
	c. Velocity = length / time
5. Significant Figures
	a. Two classes of numbers: exact or inexact
		- all measurements are considered inexact
		- you can estimate one place past the instrument; ie, the first uncertain digit
	b. Rules of Sig-Figs
		- Nonzero figures are always significant
		- Zeros between nonzeros are significant
		- Zeros proceeding the decimal are not significant
		- Zero following the last nonzero are significant if decimal point is present
		- Zeros following the last digit w/ no decimal may or may not be significant (ambiguous)
	c. Scientific Notation is non-ambiguous: WYSIWYG
	d. Rules of Calculation
		- __Addition and Subtraction__  sigfigs to the right of the decimal limiting
		```
		ex. 8.7397 - 2.123 = 6.167
		```
		- __Multiplication and Division__ fewest sigfigs total limiting
		```
		ex. 2.7832 / 1.4 = 2.0
		```
6. Accuracy vs Precision
	a. __Accuracy__ is the difference between measurement with the accepted value 
	b. __Precision__ describes the amount of deviation between tests taken on the same event
