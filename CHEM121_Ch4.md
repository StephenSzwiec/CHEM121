##Stoichiometry of Chemical Reactions

###I. Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations
1. Chemical Equations are used to represent chemical reactions
	a. The substances undergoing reaction are **reactants**
	b. The substances generated by the reaction are **products**
	c. Plus signs (+) separate individual reactant and product formulas; an arrow (--->) separates the reactant and product (left and right) sides of the equation
	d. The relative numbers of reactant and products species are represented by **coefficients** which are usually integers; coefficient of 1 is usually omitted
	
	Example: **N<sub>2</sub>(g) + 3H<sub>2</sub>(g) ---> 2NH<sub>3</sub>(g)**
	
2. **Law of Conservation of Matter** states that matter cannot be created or destroyed; no reaction creates or destroys matter, so equations must be balanced.
3. Balanced equations have integer coefficients that balance both atoms and charges on both sides of the equation
4. If uncombined elements appear on both sides of the reaction, these are saved for last when balancing
5. Polyatomic ions are balanced as a unit (unless disassociated by the reaction)
6. Reversible Reactions
	a. some reactions are reversible, which is to say that under certain conditions, the reaction will travel between reactants and products simultaneously 
	b. denoted by (<--->) these reactions reach a point at which the forward and reverse reactions occur at equal rates
	c. Two conditions exist for which equilibrium point is reached
		- it is, indeed, a reversible reaction
		- rate of forward reaction = rate of reverse
	d. When describing reversible reactions, the equilibrium point can be described as **product favored** or **reactant favored**
7. Net ionic equations
	a. **net ionic equation** describes an equation which happens between dissociated ionic compounds in solution, and which remove **spectator ions** which do not react to form a product
	b. despite this, net ionic equations require balancing just as any equation
		
###II. Solubility and Dissociation in Aqueous Solutions

###III. Redox Reactions
1. Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) Reactions
	a. Definitions
		- **Oxidation** is loss of electrons
		- **Reduction** is gain of electrons
		- **Oxidation Agents** receive electrons
		- **Reducing Agents** donate electrons
		- Try to remember **O.I.L.R.I.G.** : oxidation is loss, reduction is gain
	b. During redox reactions, electron transfer occurs
	c. Oxidation numbers are used to keep track of electrons 
	d. **Rules for Assigning oxidation numbers**
		1. Any pure element has an oxidation number of 0
		2. Any monoatomic ion is equal to charge of ion: Ex; **NaCl ---> Na<sup>+</sup> = +1, Cl<sup>-</sup> = -1**
		3. The sum of oxidation numbers of all atoms in a compound = 0 
		4. The sum of oxidation numbers of a polyatomic ion is = charge of the ion
		5. **F<sup>-</sup>** is always -1 when paired in a compound or ion
		6. **Group IA** = +1; **Group IIA** = +2; **Al** = +3; **Ga, In,** and **Tl** = +3 usually, but occasionally +1
		7. **H** has an oxidation of -1 in **metal hydrides** and in all other compounds +1
		8. **O** is always -2, unless with:
			- Peroxides (**O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>**) in these, **O** = -1
			- Superoxides (**O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>**) in these, **O** = -Â½
			- In **OF<sub>2</sub>** only, **O** = +2
		9. **Group VA** elements have oxidation #s of -3 in binary compounds when with metals, **H**, or **NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>**; in compounds or with polyatomic ions with elements to the right of **group VA**, the charge of the elements will vary based on other elements
		10. **Group VIA** -2 with when with metals, **H**, or **NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>**; otherwise, determined by the elements on the right
		11. **Group VIIA** -1 w/ metals, **H**, or **NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>**; the lighter Halogen or **O** may determine otherwise. 
	e. The oxidation number for an oxidation-reduction reaction keep track of electron exchange 
	f. The total lost of electrons lost will = number of electrons gained
	g. Common oxidation agents include: **O<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2+</sup>,** and **MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>**
	h. Common reducing agents include: **O<sub>2</sub>, Na, K, Fe, Al,** and **C**
2. Redox Reaction Balancing - The Half-Reaction Method
	a. Start w/ the unbalanced equation and assign oxidation numbers to atoms
	b. Based on the oxidation numbers, decide what is **oxidized**, and what is **reduced**
	c. Write out the half reactions, including electrons (**e<sup>-</sup>**)
	d. Account for the change in oxidation numbers by adding electrons as reactants or products
	e. Balance **O** or **H** by adding **H<sup>+</sup>** or **OH<sup>-</sup>**
	f. Multiply the half-reactions by integers so that each half-reaction has an equal number of electrons
	g. Add the two half-reactions together and simplify when possible; if something is both a product and a reactant, remove it.
	h. **In a Basic Solution only** add **OH<sup>-</sup>** to both sides to balance out hydronium and produce **H<sub>2</sub>O**.
	i. Go through the final equation and ensure charges and atoms are balanced

###IV. Other Types of Reactions
1. **Combination** a reaction where larger molecules are built from smaller units in the general form **A + B ---> AB**
	
	Example: **2Na + Cl<sub>2</sub> ---> 2NaCl**
	
2. **Decomposition** a reaction where larger molecules are broken into smaller units in the form **AB ---> A + B**
	
	Example: **2H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ---> 2H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub>**
	
3. **Single Displacement**
	a. Single Displacement reactions are also *always* Redox reactions
	b. More reactive metals will bump out cations from an ionic substance, based on their reactivity
	c. More reactive | **K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al, C, Zn, Fe, Sn, Pb, H, Cu, Ag, Au** | Least Reactive
	
	Example: **2Na + 2H<sub>2</sub>O ---> 2NaOH + H<sub>2</sub>**
	
4. **Double Displacement** reactions are further classified into three types, based on products of the reaction and have the general form of **AB + CD ---> AD + CB**
	a. Acid-Base Neutralization 
		- produce water and a salt in the general form of **Acid + Base ---> Water + Salt**
		- remember that when doing net ionic equations, that weak acids and bases are not dissociated 
	
	Example: **CH<sub>3</sub>COOH<sub></sub>(aq) + KOH<sub></sub>(aq) ---> KCH<sub>3</sub>COO (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l)**
	
	b. Precipitate Forming 
		- have a solid fall out of the solution, the **precipitate**
		- use solubility rules to determine which substance is not soluble
		- if there is no precipitate, then no reaction occurs 
	
	Example: **Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(aq) + K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>(aq) ---> CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2KNO<sub>3</sub>(aq)**
		
	c. Gas Forming 
		- some substances are formed which immediately decompose because they are not stable
		- **HCO<sub>3</sub>** decomposes into **H<sub>2</sub>O** and **CO<sub>2</sub>**
		
	Example: **2HCl<sub>(aq)</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (aq) ---> 2NaCl (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) + CO<sub>2</sub> (g)**
	
###V. Reaction Stiochiometry
1. The balanced equation can be used to find reaction ratios (in mol:mol)
2. The ratios can be used to obtain amounts needed for specific reactions
3. This can be used to determine how much of a reactant would be needed to make a product, or which reactants are limiting in a reaction
4. Conversion
	a. Molarity provides a conversion between volume and moles
	b. Molar mass provides a conversation between mass and moles
	c. To use the stoichiometric ratio (mole ratio) from a balanced equation, moles, either from Molarity or Molar Mass are needed.
5. Using Solutions in Chemical Reactions
	a. pH can be used to express how acidic or basic a solution is. It is defined as the negative of the logarithm of concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions
	<pre>pH = -log(H<sup>+</sup>) </pre>
	b. Pure water has a pH = 7 at 25Â°C because the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> is 1.00 x 10<sup>-7</sup>
	c. Acidic solutions have a pH of less than 7, Basic solutions have a pH of more than 7. 

	**Example** : Determine the pH of a 0.00152M solution of HNO<sub>3</sub>
	<pre>
HNO<sub>3</sub> ---> H<sup>+</sup> + HNO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
pH = -log( .00152) = 6.48
	</pre>
**Example** : Determine the H<sup>+</sup> concentration of a solution having a pH = 8.25
	<pre>
H<sup>+</sup> = 10<sup>-pH</sup>
H<sup>+</sup> = 10<sup>-8.25</sup>
H<sup>+</sup> = 5.62 x 10â»â¹ M
	</pre>

###VI. Quantitative Chemical Analysis
1. The balanced equation can be used to find reaction ratios
2. Reaction ratios (of moles) can be used to obtain amounts needed to complete a reaction
3. The **Limiting Reactant** is that which produces the least amount of theoretical yield
4. Yields
	a. **Theoretical Yield** is the ideal reaction as represented by the chemical equation; real life chemistry is rarely ideal
	b. **Actual Yield** is the experimentally acquired, measured product obtained by a reaction under a set of perimeters
	c. **% Yield** is the percent, equal to: **(actual yield / theoretical yield) x100%**
5. Quantitative Analysis
	a. analysis of a mixture can be performed by reacting components of the mixture and obtaining a substance which is isolated from the mixture
	b. an **analyte** is the target of the analysis, and is converted by reaction into one or more substances of known composition
	c. these substances can be used with stoichiometric ratios to be used in calculating the amount of analyte in the original sample

**Example**
A 1.506g sample of limestone containing material give off 0.558g of CO<sub>2</sub> gas, in addition to CaO after being heated to a high temperature, what is the mass percent of CaCO<sub>3</sub> in the sample?
<pre>
0.588g CO<sub>2</sub> * (1mol CO<sub>2</sub>/44.01g CO<sub>2</sub>) * (1mol CaCO<sub>3</sub>/1mol CO<sub>2</sub>) * (100.09g CaCO<sub>3</sub>/1mol CaCO<sub>3</sub>) 
= 1.34g CaCO<sub>3</sub>
(1.34g CaCO<sub>3</sub> / 1.506g sample) * 100% = 88.8%
</pre>
Therefore, the sample was **88.8%** CaCO<sub>3</sub> by mass.
