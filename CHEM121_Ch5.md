# Chapter 5 
## Thermochemistry
### I. Definitions
1. **Thermodynamics** the study of energy and its transformations
2. **Energy** the ability to do work
3. **Work** movement of a force through distance

### II. Classifications of energy
1. **Kinetic energy** is the energy of motion and is equal to **1/2 * mass * velocity<sup>2</sup>**
2. Kinetic energy includes 
	a. **Thermal Energy** energy of heat, is the motion of atoms and molecules at the atomic level
	b. **Mechanical Energy** motion of macroscopic objects moving from place to place (baseballs, bullets, etc.)
	c. **Electric Energy** movement of electrons through a conducting material
	d. **Sound** compression and expansion within a medium
3. **Potential energy** energy of position, an object has energy stored due to its position
4. Potential energy includes
	a. **Gravitational Energy** which is how an object can move downward; equal to **mass * gravitational force * height**
	b. **Chemical Potential Energy** is thermal energy stored due to position of electrons in a substance. This means there is energy stored within the bonds and it can be released
	c. **Electrostatic Energy** attraction between oppositely charged ions within substances 
5. Potential energy can be turned into kinetic energy, and vice versa

### III. Measuring Energy
1. **Law of Conservation of Energy** energy in a system cannot be created or destroyed; it can be transformed from one type to another. Also known as the **First Law of Thermodynamics**
2. SI unit of energy is the **Joule (J)** = **kgm<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>**; KJ are commonly used 
3. Another unit of energy is the **calorie**, defined experimentally as the energy to *raise the temperature of 1g of water 1°C*. Dietary calories are actually **Kcal**. 1 calorie is equal to **EXACTLY 4.184 J** (please memorize this)

### IV. Heat vs Temperature
1. **Heat** is another name for thermal energy, or the kinetic energy and is not directly measurable due to the atomic-level vibrations of any substance. It is an extensive property (larger bodies at the same temperature contain more heat.)
2. **Temperature** is an intensive property of matter and is an indirect measure of its heat. Reflected to be the average kinetic energy of a system. 
3. Thermal Equilibrium
	a. Objects in a system tend to reach a thermal equilibrium 
	b. Two objects have reached the same final temperature when they have reached thermal equilibrium
	c. **Heat lost = -(Heat gained)**

### V. Thermal Systems
1. A **System** is an object or collection of objects under study
2. **Surroundings** are everything outside of the system that can be influenced by the system (and vice versa)
3. **Universe** = System + Surroundings
4. Types of Systems
	a. **Open Systems** can exchange matter and energy with the surroundings
	b. **Closed Systems** can exchange energy but not matter with surroundings
	c. **Isolated systems** can exchange neither matter nor energy with the surroundings
5. System Processes
	a. **Exothermic process** cause a system to give up heat to the surroundings
	b. **Endothermic process** cause a system to absorb heat from the surroundings
6. amount of heat transferred in a process depends upon the
	a. amount of the material 
	b. the size of the temperature changes
	c. the identity of the substances involved
7. Different substances absorb and lose heat differently
	a. the **specific heat** is capacity for heat of a type of object
	b. defined as the amount of heat needed to accomplish an observable heat change
	c. specific heat capacity is denoted as **C** and equals the amount of heat needed to change the *temperature of 1g of a substance by exactly 1°C* 
	- units of specific heat capacity **(J / g * °C)**
8. Heat Transferred
	- **q** denotes is the amount of heat transferred 
	- q is _positive_ for an endothermic process (system gaining heat) and _negative_ for an exothermic process (system loses heat)
	- **q = C * m *  ∆T**; where **∆T = T<sub>final</sub> - T<sub>initial</sub>**

### V. Systems
1. Equal but opposite heat transfer is observed between water and the system within an aqueous solution (Heat loss = -(Heat gain)
2. Remember: **q = C * m *  ∆T**; heat is equal to capacity of heat times mass of substance in system times change in time

Example: a 75.0g of meal are heated to 99.8°C in a boiling water bath. The metal is then transferred to a 50.0g of H<sub>2</sub>O at 20.5°C in a coffee cup calorimeter. The final temp of the metal and H<sub>2</sub>O is 30.1°C. Find the specific heat of the metal. 

<pre>
q<sub>sys</sub> = q<sub>sur</sub>
q<sub>metal</sub> = -q<sub>water</sub>
M<sub>metal</sub> * C<sub>metal</sub> * ∆T<sub>metal</sub>  = (M<sub>water </sub> * C<sub>water</sub> * ∆T<sub>water</sub>)
75.0g * C<sub>metal</sub> * (30.1°C - 99.8°C) = -(50.0g * 4.184J/g * (30.1°C - 20.5°C))
C<sub>metal</sub> = (-2008.82) / (75.0)(-69.7)
C<sub>metal</sub> = 0.384 J/ g * °C
</pre>

### VI. Change of Phase
1. A change of a substance state does take an amount of energy
2. Remember: 
	a. Melting = solid + heat -> liquid
	b. Freezing = liquid -> solid + heat
	c. Vaporization = liquid + heat -> gas
	d. Condensation = gas -> liquid + heat 
	e. Sublimation = solid + heat -> gas 
	f. Deposition  = gas -> solid + heat
3. Energy has to be added or removed from a system to create a change in phase
4. To go from a solid to liquid, liquid to gas, or solid to a gas, heat has to be gained by the system, making it endothermic
5. To go from a liquid to a solid, gas to liquid, or gas to solid, heat has to be lost by the system, making it exothermic
6. Heat of fusion (liquid to solid and vice versa) of H<sub>2</sub>O at 0C is 333J/g
7. Heat of vaporization (gas to liquid and vice versa) of H<sub>2</sub>O at 0C is 2256J/g
8. when you make a phase change, temperature holds as the phase changes; *temp does not change during a phase change.*
9. each phase of a substance has a different specific heat; solids, liquids, and gases of the same substance will have different specific heat 

EX: Calculate the amount of heat given off when 100.0g of steam at 100°C is converted to ice at 0°C.
<pre>
q<sub>1</sub> = -(2256J/g * 100.0g) 
q<sub>2</sub> = -(M<sub>water </sub> * C<sub>water</sub> * ∆T<sub>water</sub>) =  (100.0g * 4.184J/g * -100°C)
q<sub>3</sub> = -(333J/g * 100.0g)

therefore, q<sub>1</sub> + q<sub>2</sub> + q<sub>3</sub> = 300700. J or 300.7KJ
</pre>

**Review Example**: A 45g peice of Aluminium is heated in a hot water bath which is 98.5C. Aluminium has a specific heat of 0.88 J/g*C. The aluminium is then place into a coffee cup calorimeter and containing 65mL of water at 22C. What is the final or equilibrium temperature. 
<pre>
q<sub>Al</sub> = -q<sub>water</sub>
C * m *  ∆T = - ( C * m *  ∆T)
45g * 0.88J/g* °C  * (F - 98.5°C ) = - ( 65g * 4.184 J / g * °C * ( F - 22°C )
39.6(F-98.5°C) = -271.96(F- 22°C )
39.6F - 3900.6°C  = -271.96F + 5983.12°C 
F = 32°C 
</pre>

### VII. Thermodynamics
1. **First Law of Thermodynamics** energy in a system cannot be created or destroyed; it can be transformed from one type to another. 
	a. One statement of the 1st law is that energy is conversed, although it can be transformed
	b. Another way to transfer energy include heat and work
2. When the system does work on the surroundings, the system has to exert energy on the surroundings to do work
3. **U** = **internal energy of a system**; massively hard to calculate of the system due to including energy of motion, energy of vibration, energy of rotation, bond energy, electrostatic energy, etc. 
4. It is difficult to directly measure **U** but we can easily understand changes in internal energy
5. Therefore another statement of the 1st law is **∆U = q + w**, where **w** is equal to work
6. **w** is *positive* when work is done to the system, while it is *negative* when work is being done by the system (energy exerted on the system surroundings)
7. for Pressure-volume work, **w = -P∆V** where work is equal to the negative vector of Pressure times change in Volume; the negative sign is necessary to make the work negative for expansion 
8. **H** = enthalpy, **∆H** is the heat transferred at constant pressure. **∆H** is equal to **q** in systems (which is to say, positive during endothemic processes, and negative during exothermic processes)
9. Therefore **∆U = ∆H + w**, and if the system is not a gas, then expansion can be considered 0, so **∆U = ∆H** when the system is not a gas.
10. For chemical reactions, **∆H = H<sub>final</sub> - H<sub>initial</sub>** or **H<sub>products</sub> - H<sub>reactants</sub>**
11. The enthalpy change of a reaction is denoted by subscript <sub>RXN</sub>

**Example:** 
**CH<sub>4</sub>(g) + 2 O<sub>2</sub>(g)  ---> CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(g)  |  ∆H = -890 kJ**
When written in this form, it implies that every 1 mole of **CH<sub>4</sub>** reacts with 2moles of **O<sub>2</sub>** to produce 1 mole of **CO<sub>2</sub>** and 2 moles of **H<sub>2</sub>0**, and gives off **890kJ** in heat.

12. Important things to keep in mind
	a. Physical states of the substances matter
	b. **∆H** is negative for exothermic reactions and positive for endothermic reactions
	c. **H** is an extrinsic property of substances in a reaction
	
Example: 
Determine the amount of heat released when 454g of **CH<sub>4</sub>** is burned in the presence of excess Oxygen
<pre>
Given: (- 890kJ / 1 mol CH<sub>4</sub>)
454g CH<sub>4</sub> * ( 1mol CH<sub>4</sub> / 16.05g ) * (-890kJ / 1mol CH<sub>4</sub>)  = 25,200 kJ 
</pre>
therefore **25,200 kJ** are released by the system

13. It's not easy to measure the enthalpy of a system, but enthalpy change of a reaction is observable
14. However, because **H** is a state function is is usually possible to combine a series of reaction with known **∆H** to obtain the total **∆H**

15. **Hess' Law of Summation**: if a reaction is the sum of two or more reactions, **∆H** for the overall process is the sum of the **∆H** values of those reactions.

Example: Calculate **∆H** for the reaction NO + O ---> NO<sub>2</sub>
Given the following
<pre>
NO + O<sub>3</sub> ---> NO<sub>2</sub>  |  ∆H = -198.9kJ
O3 ---> 3/2 O2   |  ∆H = -142.3kJ
O2 ---> 2O  |  ∆H = 495.0kJ

NO + O3 ---> NO2   ∆H = -198.9kJ
3/2 O2 ---> O3   ∆H = 142.3kJ
1/2(2O --> O2) ∆H = 1/2(-495.0kJ)
</pre>	
	Therefore **∆H<sub>rxn</sub> = -304.1kJ**

16. **∆H** is hard to formulate, so it is more convenient to be able to look up **∆H** on tables. 
17. By definition, the standard enthalpy of formation **∆H<sup>0</sup><sub>F</sub>** for any element in its natural state is zero. Natural state is considered 298K at 1atm. 
18. Any reaction can be written as a sum of formation reaction so any **∆H<sub>rxn</sub>** can be written as a sum of  **∆H<sup>0</sup><sub>F</sub>** values. 
	**Example:**	
	<pre>
	C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>(g) + 5O<sub>2</sub>(g) --> 3CO<sub>2</sub>(g) + 4H<sub>2</sub>O(g)

	can be written as:
		C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>(g) --> 3C(s) + 4H2(g) 	| -1 * ∆H<sup>0</sup><sub>F</sub> C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>(g)
		3C(s) + 3O<sub>2</sub> ---> 3CO<sub>2</sub>(g)	|   3 * ∆H<sup>0</sup><sub>F</sub> CO<sub>2</sub>(g)
		2O<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2H<sub>2</sub> ---> 4H<sub>2</sub>O 4  |	4 * ∆H<sup>0</sup><sub>F</sub> H<sub>2</sub>O(g)
	</pre>
19. In general,  **∆H<sup>0</sup><sub>F</sub>** = **Σ: ∆H<sup>0</sup><sub>F</sub>(n reactants)** or the sum of molar sum of formation of the reactants, which is equal to **Σ: ∆H<sup>0</sup><sub>F</sub>(n products)** in a reaction. This is usually described in kJ/mol
20. In general, reactions that have large negative values for **∆H<sup>0</sup><sub>F</sub>**, this reaction is heavily product favored; reactions with large positive values for **∆H<sup>0</sup><sub>F</sub>** are reactant favored. 
21. Energy and enthalpy changes are one factor in whether or not a reaction occurs as written

**Example:**
	<pre>
	2F<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)  --> 4HF(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)
		2 * (F<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>(g) --> 2HF(g)  |  ∆H =  -546.6 kJ) 
 		-1 * (2H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) --> 2H<sub>2</sub>0(l)  | ∆H = -571.6 kJ)
 	therefore, 2F<sub>2</sub>(g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)  --> 4HF(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g)  | ∆H = -521.6 kJ
 	</pre>
